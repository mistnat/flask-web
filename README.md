Flask Website with log in page that passes usernames and passwords from a database using SQLite


I am designing a Computer Science Revision website for GCSE Students.
This website will give the students access to tips about how to revise specific difficult content, allow them to take quizzes that quiz them on the content, and in turn, it should be used to help students with learning Computing definitions.

I aim to create a website that includes: dynamically changing content (i.e. charts of students' progress), a sorting database, cross-table SQL, a login system with admin/teacher login (including sessions), and quiz taking.

I will be researching similar quiz websites online that include a login option and websites that store data (eg overall marks on a quiz) in a database.
